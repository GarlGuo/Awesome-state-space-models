1. Variational quantization for state space models(https://openreview.net/forum?id=EAkjVCtRO2)
    In this work, we pro- pose a new forecasting model that combines discrete state space hidden Markov models with recent neural network architectures and training procedures inspired by vector quantized variational autoencoders.
    We introduce a variational discrete posterior distribution of the latent states given the observations and a two-stage training procedure to alternatively train the parameters of the latent states and of the emission distributions.
